# Milk-Quality-Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts the quality of milk based on its chemical and physical properties such as pH, fat content, and turbidity.  
The model classifies milk as Low, Medium, or High quality using various supervised learning algorithms.

## Features
- Trained multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)  
- Deployed the  with **Streamlit** for real-time prediction  
- Interactive user interface for easy input and live results

## Tech Stack
- Languages: Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit  
- Techniques: Classification, Feature Scaling 

## Dataset used 
Milk Quality Prediction on Kaggle

## Results
- Achieved strong predictive accuracy for milk quality classification
- Provided intuitive visualization and user-friendly prediction interface

## Future Improvements
- Add more milk composition parameters for higher accuracy
- Implement automatic data logging for model retraining
- Enhance UI for better usability
